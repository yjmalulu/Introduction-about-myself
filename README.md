A Mom's Journey to FinTech: From Pharmacist to Blockchain Enthusiast
My name is Lulu, and I'm a full-time mom of two amazing girls, ages 6 and 8. Before moving to San Diego from China, I worked as a pharmacist, leveraging my Master's degree in Pharmaceutics. While raising my daughters is incredibly rewarding, I've always known I wanted to explore new opportunities and contribute to a fast-growing field.

My interest in the world of blockchain began in 2017, shortly after the birth of my youngest daughter. The concept of a secure, decentralized ledger system fascinated me, and I saw its potential to revolutionize various industries. As I dug deeper, I realized that blockchain technology had the power to significantly impact the financial sector, leading me to choose FinTech as my new career path.

While I have no formal background in finance or programming, I'm a dedicated learner and eager to leverage my existing skills and knowledge to navigate this exciting field. I'm particularly interested in understanding cryptocurrencies and the intricate workings of blockchain technology.

My journey into FinTech is driven by a desire for continuous learning and the opportunity to contribute to a rapidly evolving sector that holds immense potential for positive change. I'm excited to explore the various career options within FinTech and am confident that my passion, dedication, and willingness to learn will pave the way for success in this new chapter of my life.
